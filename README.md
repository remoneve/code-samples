# code-samples

Each language-named folder contains some "demo"-excercises from different courses (for ex. Programming 1 & 2 and Python programming)

(Some of the variables and documentation might be written in finnish as that was suggested/required by the course.)

More JavaScript and React (also TypeScript in part9) examples can be found in my Full Stack Open -repository: [FSOrepo](https://github.com/remoneve/FSOrepo)
